# Three.js Chess

This project was initially planned to get to know Three.js a little better, but I want to build a fully working chess game.

## Setup
This project is build with node.js, so to test the program, you have to install the packages and build the project.

```bash
# Install node packages
npm install

# Build project
npm run build
```
